1524859114588979212,@fawfulfan Legacy automakers by comparison are doing a poor job of securing both chips and batteries. Meanwhile Tesla has built their own battery factories and massively reduced part counts through gigacastings no one else is attempting. They build cars in 1/3 the time of VW.

Most people live in cities, and cities benefit massively from public transit. You're being willfully dishonest to say I'm arguing for the end of all cars for everyone everywhere"
1524858205506981888,@jaasak I thought about getting a Tesla then I thought the hassle of charging the fcking thing. Wkends here you see all the charging stations full and cars lined up waiting to charge. Casinos only have a couple of charging stations(less than 3) in valet parking. 😕

1524857103571197957,@bjaninemorison Here's what we do. We buy up the Tesla's when they get cheap enough then we form a Tesla club. We exchange parts with each other until there are only five left in the world. Now we own million dollar cars because there are only five of them.
