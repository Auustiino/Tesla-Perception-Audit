1525064127864918018,Interesting timing for this announcement. Tesla‚Äôs stock price has shed over $200 since the announcement Musk was to buy Twitter. Tesla stock was security for a substantial portion of the loans Musk was to finance the deal with. https://t.co/DTDfcDcku0
1525064068909891585,@kevinriggle @Quinnae_Moon It is common speculation that the Twitter deal has mainly been about him intentionally tanking Tesla's stock to facilitate a buy-back
1525064066087141377,@Blackamazon It's the tanking price of Tesla stock creating buyer's remorse. Bots are the excuse.
1525064064774316033,"@56blackcat Tesla stock is tanking, he‚Äôs got lawsuits and investigations pending, and maybe he‚Äôs starting to realize that there isn‚Äôt an easy way (beyond the current advertising) to monetize Twitter. Nobody is going to pay for it and there‚Äôs no good way to recoup his losses if he buys it."
